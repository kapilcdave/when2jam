> The minimalist way to find a time to jam.

A lightweight, real-time availability scheduler built for musicians, teams, and friends who want to find common free time without the friction of complex calendar apps.

## ✨ Why when2jam?

- **No Sign-Ups**: Share a link, start collaborating instantly
- **Lightning Fast**: Minimal UI, maximum speed
- **Mobile Native**: Built for thumb-friendly interactions
- **Real-Time Sync**: See everyone's availability update live
- **Visual Heatmap**: Green shading shows group availability at a glance
- **Privacy Focused**: No tracking, no databases storing personal data beyond the event

---

## 🎯 How It Works

1. **Create an Event**: Pick your time range (up to 7 days) and event name
2. **Mark Your Time**: Click & drag across time slots to mark when you're available
3. **Share the Link**: One-click copy to clipboard—no registration needed
4. **See Results**: Watch in real-time as others mark their availability
5. **Find the Sweet Spot**: Green-shaded cells show when the group is most available

## 🚀 Getting Started

### Prerequisites
- Node.js 18+
- npm or yarn
- Supabase account (free tier works great)

### Local Development

1. **Clone the repo**
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/kapilcdave/when2jam.git
   cd when2jam
   ```

2. **Install dependencies**
   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

3. **Set up environment variables**
   Copy `.env.example` to `.env.local` and fill in your Supabase values:
   ```env
   NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_URL=your_supabase_url
   NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_ANON_KEY=your_supabase_anon_key
   ```

4. **Set up Supabase**
   Run `supabase/migrations/0001_initial_schema.sql` in the Supabase SQL Editor if you are creating a fresh project.

5. **Run the development server**
   ```bash
   npm run dev
   ```
   Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) in your browser.

## 📦 Building for Production

```bash
npm run build
npm start
```

Or deploy directly to Vercel:
```bash
npm install -g vercel
vercel
```

## Supabase Recovery

The deployed app was found pointing at Supabase project ref `wflwbjwjseuijbkrvgnj`. If the project is paused, resume it in Supabase and redeploy Vercel with the current `NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_URL` and `NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_ANON_KEY`.

If the old project cannot be resumed, create a new Supabase project, run `supabase/migrations/0001_initial_schema.sql`, update the two Vercel environment variables, and redeploy. See `docs/RECOVERY.md` for the full recovery checklist.

## 🎨 Design Philosophy

- **Minimalist**: Remove friction, keep focus on finding time
- **Accessible**: High contrast, keyboard & touch friendly
- **Fast**: Instant interactions, no loading spinners where possible
- **Mobile-First**: 30-minute time slots are tap-friendly
